# Field Axioms

Analytics is branch of mathematics where we study the properties and structures of fields. Let's start with the easiest example of a field: the set of real numbers, denoted by \( \mathbb{R} \).

## Set of Real Numbers.
A set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is defined(from wikipedia) as follows:

et R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } denote the set of all real numbers. Then:

    The set R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is a field, meaning that addition and multiplication are defined and have the usual properties.
    The field R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is ordered, meaning that there is a total order ≥ such that for all real numbers x, y and z:
        if x ≥ y, then x + z ≥ y + z;
        if x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, then xy ≥ 0.
    The order is Dedekind-complete, meaning that every nonempty subset S of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with an upper bound in R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } has a least upper bound (a.k.a., supremum) in R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }.

The last property applies to the real numbers but not to the rational numbers (or to other more exotic ordered fields). For example, { x ∈ Q : x 2 < 2 } {\displaystyle \{x\in \mathbb {Q} :x^{2}<2\}} has a rational upper bound (e.g., 1.42), but no least rational upper bound, because 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is not rational. 

Let \( \mathbb{R} \) denote the set of real numbers.  Then
 - The set \( \mathbb{R} \) is a field, meaning that addition and multiplication are defined and have the usual properties.
 - The field \( \mathbb{R} \) is ordered, meaning that there is a total order \( \geq \) such that for all real numbers \( x, y \) and \( z \):
   - if \( x \geq y \), then \( x + z \geq y + z \);
   - if \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \), then \( xy \geq 0 \).
 - The order is Dedekind-complete, meaning that every nonempty subset \( S \) of \( \mathbb{R} \) with an upper bound in \( \mathbb{R} \) has a least upper bound (a.k.a., supremum) in \( \mathbb{R} \).
