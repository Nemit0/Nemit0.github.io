# What's this blog?

Hi, I'm Nemit. Mathematics major, computer science enthusiast, and all-around curious person.

I'm interested in mathematics, computer science, programming, AI, AI Ethics, information theory and bunch of other topics.

I probably post some random stuff, along with what i study and stuff. All posts will be written in both English and Korean. I probably won't be writing both version and use some llm or ai to translate. If either one of the versions are awkward, there's your culprit. If it bugs you to point where you want to fix it, feel free to open a PR. The link to this repo is [here](http://github.com/Nemit0/Nemit0.github.io).

I'm not a professional writer, nor is an expert on the domain of what i write. I don't even have a bachlor's degree in mathematics. Feel free to point out any mistakes you find in the posts. Again, PRs are welcome.
