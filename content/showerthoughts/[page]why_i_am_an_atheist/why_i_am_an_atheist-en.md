# Why I Am an Atheist

I tell many people I meet and interact with that I am an atheist. It's just a casual thing like "Oh i don't like pineapple on my pizza" or "I prefer tea over coffee". Interestingly though, I've been through some phase in my life when i were, actually an theist.

Back in my elementary days, when I were in China, Dalian, attending a international school, I spoke broken English, little to no chinese and had no friends. My parents worried that i'll be a literal talking potato when we went back to Korea, made me attend a private math academy. To make things clear, My family have a buddist background. My grandmother, grandmother in law are both buddist, my mom and dad non-religious though they went to buddist temple regularly not for religious purpose(or least I suspect), but just because of momentum...I guess?

At that private academy I were taught by a devoute christian instructor. She taught me math, and occasionally interjected with stories from the bible. I were kinda going through rough time and kinda wanted to feel included in any social group because, as i quite literally could not make a meaningful converstaion with anyone at school kinda thought this were something that was for me. To be included in some kind of social circle. I studied the bible, conversed with my instructor and due to unrelated reasons quit that academy. I completely forgot about the whole thing until years later.

Que to my teenage years, i were having more rough times because you know, being a teenager does bring a whole new set of mental problems. Swear to god my depression first staretd at that time.
