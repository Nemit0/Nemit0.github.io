# Nemit0.github.io

Repository for my personal blog. All pages are written as markdown in content pages, and rendered using Jekyll.

I probably post some random stuff, along with what i study and stuff. All posts will be written in both English and Korean. I probably won't be writing both version and use some llm or ai to translate. If either one of the versions are awkward, there's your culprit. If it bugs you to point where you want to fix it, feel free to open a PR.

Feel free to fork this for your own blog.
